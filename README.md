ðŸ’» Passionate about technology and constantly learning. 

I have studied computer science in different places, which has given me a broad perspective and a good foundation
in software, system and technology development in general.

Although I am new to the sector, I have a great motivation to learn and grow professionally. I am excited to face
new challenges, explore innovative solutions and continue to expand my knowledge to add value to each project I participate in.

ðŸš€ Always open to opportunities and connections in the world of technology.
